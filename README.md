# User Authentication with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Welcome to the User Authentication with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) repository! This project aims to provide a secure and seamless authentication system for web applications, utilizing server-side rendering for enhanced performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implement robust authentication mechanisms to ensure user data security and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Utilize SSR to render pages on the server before sending them to the client, enhancing performance and SEO.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.
- **Session Management**: Implement session management to maintain user sessions and provide a seamless browsing experience.
- **Password Hashing**: Securely hash user passwords using bcrypt to protect sensitive information.
- **Middleware-based Authentication**: Use middleware functions to authenticate user requests and restrict access to protected routes.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure method for transmitting information between parties as JSON objects.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **Handlebars (hbs)**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies in Express.
- **nodemon**: Utility for auto-restarting the server during development.
